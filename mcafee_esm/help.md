###### ESM Event Field and Filtering

When designing a config for the `Get New Events` trigger. You have a lot of options at hand. Below, we will outline each option with some examples.

`fields` - These are the name/types that will be entered into as an array. Fields help describe the output that you would like returned.
To get a list of fields for events or additional information see `https://<ESM Server>/rs/esm/help/qryGetSelectFields`.

Example Input:

```

[
  {
    "name": "AvgSeverity",
    "types": [
      "FLOAT"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Rule.msg",
    "types": [
      "STRING"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Action",
    "types": [
      "SSTRING"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "SrcIP",
    "types": [
      "IP"
    ]
  }
]

```

With will return the output of the above `{"Alert.AvgSeverity":"19", "Rule.msg":"User Logon", "Alert.Action":"8", "Alert.SrcIP":"192.168.0.36"}`

`filters` - ESM Fields Filters define how the event will be sorted. Additional information can be found at the following URL `https://<ESM Server>/rs/esm/help/types/EsmFieldType`.

Example Input:

```

[
  {
    "type": "EsmFieldFilter",
    "field": {
      "types": [
        "STRING"
      ],
      "name": "AvgSeverity"
    }
  }
]

```

###### Tracking Alerts

In `fields`, an AlertID can be returned. If this key is not added to `fields` it will automatically be appended to the end. This ensures that if the same event has been processed and the service fails the event will not show.

This field looks like:

```

{
  "name":"AlertID",
  "types":[
    "STRING"
  ]
}

```
