# Description

The Pork Knocking plugin knocks the specified ports on a host and optionally supports a payload.

Port knocking is a method of externally opening ports on a firewall by generating a connection attempt on a set of 
specified closed ports. Once a correct sequence of connection attempts is received, the firewall rules are 
dynamically modified to allow the host which sent the connection attempts to connect over specific port(s). 
A variant called single packet authorization exists, where only a single "knock" is needed, consisting of an 
encrypted packet.
