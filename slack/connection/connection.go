// API. Add any kind of long lived or custom 3rd party connection objects into this struct.
// Each instance of this struct WILL be shared globally, so be sure to add mutexes or atomic
// operations where needed.

// This will be turned into a real connection by the SDK runtime. You should never directly
// need to use this object, only the regular connection. As such, avoid adding any properties to it.
