#### Check URL Reputation

This action checks if a given URL is in the OpenPhish threat feed and returns a historic count of found URLs.

The feed is fetched by the Fetch Feed trigger which means this action must come after that step in the workflow.

|url|string|None|True|URL for checking in feed file|None|

##### Output

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|----|----|--------|-----------|
|URLReputation|object|True|Object with total matches, match for every URL cached, and if the current supplied URL is found in feed file|

### Triggers

#### Fetch Feed

This trigger is used to poll the feed file and cache it for the Check URL Reputation action.
Note that the trigger only returns data if the feed has changed since the last fetch.

##### Input

|Name|Type|Default|Required|Description|Enum|
|----|----|-------|--------|-----------|----|
|interval|integer|3600|True|Length of time to wait between polling (in seconds)|None|
