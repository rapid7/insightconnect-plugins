# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in joining the InsightConnect developer community!! Please review our [Code of Conduct] before making contributions.

There are multiple ways to contribute beyond writing code. These include:

- [Submit bugs and feature requests] with detailed information about your issue or idea.
- [Help fellow users with open issues] or [help fellow committers test recent pull requests].
- [Report a security vulnerability in InsightConnect's plugins] to Rapid7.
- Submit an updated or brand new plugin!  We are always eager for new
  integrations or features. Don't know where to start? Check out the [developer documentation].

Here is a short list of do's and don'ts to make sure *your* valuable contributions actually make
it into production.  If you do not care to follow these rules, your contribution **will** be rejected. Sorry!

## Code Contributions

- **Do** read the [developer documentation]
- **Do** stick to the [Python PEP8] and [plugin style] guides.
- **Do** follow the [50/72 rule] for Git commit messages.
- **Do** license your code as MIT.
- **Do** create a [topic branch] to work on. This helps ensure users are aware of commits on the branch being considered for merge, allows for a location for more commits to be offered without mingling with other contributor changes, and allows contributors to make progress while a PR is still being reviewed.

### Pull Requests

- **Do** write "WIP" on your PR and/or open a [draft PR] if submitting unfinished code.
- **Do** target your pull request to the **master branch**.
- **Do** specify a descriptive title to make searching for your pull request easier e.g. "Okta: add Suspend User action".
- **Do** include [console output], especially the JSON output for new features and bug fixes.
- **Do** list [verification steps] so your tests are reproducible.
- **Do** [reference associated issues] in your pull request description.
- **Don't** leave your pull request description blank.
- **Don't** abandon your pull request. Being responsive helps us land your code faster.

#### New Features

- **Do** install validator dependencies necessary to run `make validate` to find and fix any errors or warnings that come up.
- **Do** include documentation showing sample run-throughs.
- **Don't** include more than one plugin per pull request.

#### Bug Fixes

- **Do** include reproduction steps in the form of [verification steps].
- **Do** link to any corresponding [Issues] in the format of `See #1234` in your commit description.

When reporting issues:

- **Do** write a detailed description of your bug and use a descriptive title.
- **Do** include reproduction steps, stack traces, and anything that might help us fix your bug.
- **Don't** file duplicate reports; search for your bug before filing a new report.
