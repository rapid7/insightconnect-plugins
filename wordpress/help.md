## Setup

This plugin requires that the WordPress instance be configured as follows:

1. WordPress [REST APIv2 plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) must be installed
2. The default Basic Auth or Application Password plugins must not be installed

Users may choose to install the [Application-Password plugin](https://github.com/georgestephanis/application-passwords)
to avoid passing plaintext passwords over http. Otherwise, users must install the Basic Auth plugin.

The connection configuration accepts the following parameters:

|Name|Type|Default|Required|Description|Enum|
|----|----|-------|--------|-----------|----|
|credentials|credential_username_password|None|True|Password should be basic Auth or Application password|None|
|host|string|None|True|Host URL|None|

## Troubleshooting

Users will *not* show up to administrators unless they have [previously published a post](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/cant-get-user-information/).
This can be rectified by WordPress users modifying the REST plugin PHP. If users are unable to authorize, it may also be necessary to edit `.htaccess` as
described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36470998/cant-authenticate-with-basic-authentication-using-wp-rest-api-2-0-plugin) as well as adding
the following line:

```

Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization

```

The Basic Auth plugin that can be searched for in the WordPress admin console does not function properly. Instead, [this plugin](https://github.com/WP-API/Basic-Auth)
should be used though application passwords are *strongly* recommended. Testing the plugin is difficult due to the distributed nature of the WordPress API. Additionally,
the discovery process does not work on locally run webservers, as the API root will be given as `localhost` as opposed to the host IP.
