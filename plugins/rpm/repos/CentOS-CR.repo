# CentOS-CR.repo
#
# The Continuous Release ( CR )  repository contains rpms that are due in the next
# release for a specific CentOS Version ( eg. next release in CentOS-7 ); these rpms
# are far less tested, with no integration checking or update path testing having
# taken place. They are still built from the upstream sources, but might not map 
# to an exact upstream distro release.
#
# These packages are made available soon after they are built, for people willing 
# to test their environments, provide feedback on content for the next release, and
# for people looking for early-access to next release content.
#
# The CR repo is shipped in a disabled state by default; its important that users 
# understand the implications of turning this on. 
#
# NOTE: We do not use a mirrorlist for the CR repos, to ensure content is available
#       to everyone as soon as possible, and not need to wait for the external
#       mirror network to seed first. However, many local mirrors will carry CR repos
#       and if desired you can use one of these local mirrors by editing the baseurl
#       line in the repo config below.
