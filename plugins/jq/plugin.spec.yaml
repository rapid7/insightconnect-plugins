title: jq
description: '[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a command-line tool used for
  slicing, filtering, mapping, and transforming structured JSON data. The jq plugin
  passes the given list of flags to the jq command, which then runs the given filter
  expression on the given JSON input. For flexibility, the output is returned as a
  string'

  custom_cmd:

troubleshooting:
- Note that the filter expression should not be surrounded by quotes. This differs
  from use of jq on the command line, where the jq filter needs to be quoted to avoid
  collision with special shell characters.
- Likewise, individual command flags should not be surrounded by quotes.
- If the flags or filter given to jq are not well formed, this plugin returns a string
  beginning with "ill-formed jq command". One possible problem might be a mismatch
  between the expected jq version and the version actually contained in the plugin.
- If jq fails to produce output within the given timeout (or 10 seconds if not supplied)
  this plugin returns the special string `"TIMEOUT"`.
- Note that the jq command itself can return the string `"null"`. This may be expected,
  or it may indicate a problem in the given filter string.
- The `--seq` and `--stream` flags are not supported in version 0.1.0 of this plugin.
