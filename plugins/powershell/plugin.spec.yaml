troubleshooting:
- The use of round-robin DNS lookups is not supported
- If Auth Type is set to "None" the PowerShell script will execute locally on the
  Komand host. This can also be accomplished by leaving the address field blank.
- The username supplied must have local admin privileges on the remote host Windows
  computer.
- When using a domain account with NTLM the username must be in the following format
  MYDOMAIN\username
- When using the Kerberos connection option the username must be a domain account
  that has permission to join computers to the domain.
- "This plugin can connect over HTTP, the default port for this is 5985.\nIt should
  be noted that this type of connection is not secure as all information passed is
  in plain text. In addition, Windows will not allow HTTP connections by default.\n
  \nThe following commands must be run on the Windows computer that you want to connect
  to.\n\nFor more information see [Compromising Yourself with WinRM's AllowUnencrypted
  = True](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerShell/2015/10/27/compromising-yourself-with-winrms-allowunencrypted-true/)\n
  \n```\nwinrm set winrm/config/client/auth '@{Basic=\"true\"}'\nwinrm set winrm/config/service/auth
  '@{Basic=\"true\"}'\nwinrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted=\"true\"\
  }'\n```\n"
- "When using the Kerberos connection option, the username should not include an @example.com
  or other domain identifier. These will be added by the plugin as needed.\nThis plugin
  will join the Komand docker instance to the Windows domain as a computer if the
  Kerberos option is used.\nFor the Execute Script action PowerShell code should be
  submitted as base64. This can be done by copying a `.txt` file with the PowerShell
  code into the plugin.\n\n_This plugin does not validate the PowerShell code._\n
  Any errors generated on the remote computer by the PowerShell code are forwarded
  to the log file.\n\nRun this PowerShell command on a Windows host first to set up
  a unsigned certificate for authentication:\nThis will not be needed if the host
  already has a SSL certificate set up for Winrm\n\n```\nInvoke-Expression ((New-Object
  System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1'))\n\
