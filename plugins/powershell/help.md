# Description

[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-6) is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language from Microsoft that helps system administrators, power-users, and InsightConnect customers rapidly automate tasks that manage operating systems and processes. This plugin runs a PowerShell script on a remote host or locally on an InsightConnect Orchestrator.

# Key Features

* Run a PowerShell script to manage (remote) computers from the command line

# Requirements

* For local Orchestrator execution, ensure connectivity to any network resources the script will use
* For remote server execution, a PowerShell-enabled server and administrative credentials
* When adding a password for the script, try to avoid special or escape characters such as single or double quotes

# Supported Product Versions

* PowerShell 6.1.2

## Technical Details

### Actions

#### PowerShell String

This action is used to execute PowerShell script in the form of a string.

##### Input

|Name|Type|Default|Required|Description|Enum|Example|
|----|----|-------|--------|-----------|----|-------|
|address|string|None|False|IP address of the remote host e.g. 192.168.1.1. If address is left blank PowerShell will run locally|None|10.0.1.17|
|host_name|string|None|False|Case-sensitive name of the remote host, eg. MyComputer for Kerberos connection only|None|windows|
|script|string|None|True|PowerShell script as a string. In this action you can use `$username`, `$password`, `$secret_key` variables if defined in connection|None|Get-Date|

Example input:

```
{
  "address": "10.0.1.17",
  "host_name": "windows",
  "script": "Get-Date"
}
```

##### Output

|Name|Type|Required|Description|Example|
|----|----|--------|-----------|--------|
|stderr|string|False|PowerShell standard error|Fatal error.|
|stdout|string|False|PowerShell standard output|Tuesday, January 11, 2022 5:05:42 AM|

Example output:

```
{
  "stdout": "Tuesday, January 11, 2022 5:05:42 AM",
  "stderr": "Fatal error."
}
```

#### Execute Script

This action is used to execute PowerShell script encoded as a base64 file on a remote host.

##### Input

|Name|Type|Default|Required|Description|Enum|Example|
|----|----|-------|--------|-----------|----|-------|
|address|string|None|False|IP address of the remote host e.g. 192.168.1.1. If address is left blank PowerShell will run locally|None|10.0.1.15|
|host_name|string|None|False|Case-sensitive name of the remote host, eg. MyComputer for Kerberos connection only|None|windows|
|script|bytes|None|True|PowerShell script as base64. In this action you can use `$username`, `$password`, `$secret_key` variables if defined in connection|None|R2V0LURhdGU=|

Example input:

```
{
  "address": "10.0.1.15",
  "host_name": "windows",
  "script": "R2V0LURhdGU="
}
```

##### Output

|Name|Type|Required|Description|Example|
|----|----|--------|-----------|--------|
|stderr|string|False|PowerShell standard error|Fatal error.|
|stdout|string|False|PowerShell standard output|Tuesday, January 11, 2022 5:05:42 AM|

Example output:

```
{
  "stderr": "Fatal error.",
  "stdout": "Tuesday, January 11, 2022 5:05:42 AM"
}
```

### Triggers

_This plugin does not contain any triggers._

### Custom Output Types

_This plugin does not contain any custom output types._

## Troubleshooting

If Auth Type is set to "None" the PowerShell script will execute locally on the Komand host.
This can also by accomplished by leaving the address field blank.

The username supplied must have local admin privileges on the remote host Windows computer.
When using a domain account with NTLM the username must be in the following format MYDOMAIN\username
When using the Kerberos connection option the username must be a domain account that has permission to join computers to the domain.

This plugin can connect over HTTP, the default port for this is 5985. It should be noted that this type of connection is
not secure as all information passed is in plain text. In addition, Windows will not allow HTTP connections by default.
The following commands must be run on the Windows computer that you want to connect to.

For more information see [Compromising Yourself with WinRM's AllowUnencrypted = True](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerShell/2015/10/27/compromising-yourself-with-winrms-allowunencrypted-true/)

```

winrm set winrm/config/client/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'

```

When using the Kerberos connection option, the username should not include an @example.com or other domain identifier. These will be added by the plugin as needed.

This plugin will join the Komand docker instance to the Windows domain as a computer if the Kerberos option is used.

For the Execute Script action PowerShell code should be submitted as base64. This can be done by
copying a `.txt` file with the PowerShell code into the plugin.

_This plugin does not validate the PowerShell code._

Any errors generated on the remote computer by the PowerShell code
are forwarded to the log file.

Run this PowerShell command on a Windows host first to set up a unsigned certificate for authentication:
This will not be needed if the host already has a SSL certificate set up for Winrm
