  [Sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) is a powerful stream editor. This plugin uses GNU Sed 4.2.2 to manipulate input data.
  For example, from the command line, an example of the stream editor becomes clear:

  ```
  $ printf 'Cats are enjoyable animals\n' | sed 's/Cats/Dogs/'
  Dogs are enjoyable animals
  ```

    Careful attention to the use of double-quotes should be used, the expression will not work if it's surrounded by double-quotes.
    If a literal double-quote is required it must be escaped by a backslash `\`. For example:

    * `s/\"//g` - A stream editor expression to remove all double-quotes from a string.
    * `'s/\"/\'/g'` - A stream editor expression to replace all double-quotes with single-quotes.
