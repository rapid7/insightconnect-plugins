troubleshooting: "Infoblox instance is required for this plugin. Infoblox does not provide a testing environment, but they do provide a properly configured VMWare virtual machine (the default credentials are `admin:infoblox`). Details can be found [here](https://www.infoblox.com/infoblox-download-center/).\n\nWhen adding a new host make sure that a corresponding network is already created (otherwise you will get `The action is not allowed. A parent was not found.`). More details can be found in [this post](https://community.infoblox.com/t5/API-Integration/API-testing-environment-TestDrive-not-working/m-p/14047#M1765).\n\n[Infoblox Community](https://community.infoblox.com/) provides a lot of answers on different topics, make sure to check it if you run into any problems."
