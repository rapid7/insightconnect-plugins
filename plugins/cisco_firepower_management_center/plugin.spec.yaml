description: "[Cisco Firepower Management Center](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firepower-management-center/index.html) centralizes management of Cisco security solutions. The InsightConnect plugin can block URLs/hosts by adding address objects to a group tied to an existing deny-all rule; removing the object from that group unblocks. This plugin automates blocking via address object management actions."

  features: []
key_features:
  - Create block URL policy
  - Address object management to block and unblock hosts, and check if a host is already blocked
requirements:
- "Cisco Firepower Management Center server name"
- "Cisco Firepower Management Center username and password"
troubleshooting:
- "The certificate authentication is used solely in two actions, namely: `Add Scan Result` and `Bulk Add Scan Result`. Please remember, that the data entered into the certificate input field in the connection is required to be a base-64 encoded PKCS12 certificate file, exported from the Firepower Management Center server. The passphrase is a password created during the PKCS12 certificate file export.`SSL Verify` field is used by all other actions (i.e. excluding `Add Scan Result` and `Bulk Add Scan Result`), for SSL certificate verification. If the certificate is self-signed then SSL Verify should be set to `False` for those actions."
