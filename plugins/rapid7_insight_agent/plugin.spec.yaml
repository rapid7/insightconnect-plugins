support: rapid7
status: []
cloud_ready: true
fedramp_ready: true
sdk:
  type: slim
  version: 6.3.3
  user: nobody
key_features:
- The agent is used by [Rapid7 InsightIDR](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightidr/)
  and [InsightVM](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightvm/) customers to monitor
  endpoints.
requirements:
- '[Platform API Key](https://docs.rapid7.com/insight/managing-platform-api-keys/)'
- Administrator access to InsightIDR
troubleshooting:
- If the actions `Get Agent Details` and `Get All Agents by IP` return a `next cursor`
  value, it is an indication that more pages of data are available to be reviewed.
  In this instance, it is recommended to run the action multiple times and pass the
  `next cursor` value, recording all agents found.
