requirements:
  - "The application this plugin connects to needs the following permissions:
      \n\t* Directory.AccessAsUser.All
      \n\t* Directory.ReadWrite.All
      \n\t* User.ReadWrite.All
      \n\t* IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All (Types: Delegated, Application)
      \n\t* Device.ReadWrite.All
      \n\nAll those permissions can be set in Azure Portal. Under `App registrations` -> `<SELECT_YOUR_AZURE_AD_ADMIN_APP>` -> `API permissions`.\n"
  - "The application will need to be added to the `Global Administrator` role. This can be done in `Roles and administrators` in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory) via the Azure Portal.
  \n\nTo set this up, go to `Microsoft Entra ID` -> `Application Registrations`. Select the application to which you want to add the role and open the `Roles and Administrators` tab.
  Above the `Roles` table you will see a note saying `[...] this resource and can only be assigned here at directory level`. Click on this `here` link.
  \n\nThis should open the `All Roles' tab. Locate `Global Administrator` and click on it. To add your application to the role, you'll need to click the `Add assignments` button.
  Browse and select your application and click `Add`."
