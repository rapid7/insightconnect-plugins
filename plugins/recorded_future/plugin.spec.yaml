Using the Recorded Future plugin for Rapid7 InsightConnect, users can search domain lists, entity lists, and more.\n\nUse Recorded Future within an automation workflow to quickly assist with threat analysis, incident response, and vulnerability management.\n\nNote: When a plugin action that causes a file to be downloaded is invoked, the file data is parsed internally and returned in the [STIX](https://stixproject.github.io/about/) format"
